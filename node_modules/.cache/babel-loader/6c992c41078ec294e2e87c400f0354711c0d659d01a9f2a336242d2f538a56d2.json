The Middle Ages are a historical period that lasted for more than 1000 years. During this time, people wandered a lot, exploring new territories. This is how nomadic people were born. Also during this time, wars were faught everywhere in Europe. Kings and the territories they ruled, named 'kingdoms', also appeared during the Middle Ages.\",\n  \"text-1\": \"Timișoara was named 'Temesvar' back then and it was part of the kingdom of Hungary.\",\n  \"text-2\": \"The city as we know it today didn't exist yet. There were just some islands on which people built houses. There were only 20 houses and 200 inhabitants in the entire settlement. These islands were formed by the arms of the rivers Bega and Timiş. On the biggest island, a fortress of cob. That is, earth mixed with straws.\",\n  \"text-3\": \"In the Middle Ages, people lived without supermarkets and fast food. They ate fruits and vegetables from their own gardens and animals they raised in their back yard. It wasn't cool to wash and soap as we know it today didn't exist yet. They used plants to treat any disease and if the illness was more serious, they used leeches. Because Timişoara was built on islands surrounded by water, there were a lot of mosquitoes, and people were often getting sick from malaria.\",\n  \"text-4\": \"Around 1300 AD, a sort of strategy game was played between two noble men, Otto of Bavaria and Robert of Anjou.\",\n  \"text-5\": \"These two men had to prove their negociation skills and the one who managed to gain the most allies would become king of Hungary. Robert came to Timișoara to set a military base and to seek allies. He ordered the building of a bigger and stronger fortress than the one made out of cob. Robert of Anjou was very skilled in negociation, so he won the game. He then became king of Hungary and Timişoara became the capital city of the kingdom. Because of this, Timişoara became famous all over Europe, and a lot of people came to live here. The number of inhabitants grew and a lot of houses were built.\",\n  \"text-6\": \"After the city grew, Robert of Anjou moved to Buda – in the town that is now part of the city of Budapest.\",\n  \"text-7\": \"Almost 100 years after Robert of Anjou left, John Hunyadi arrived at Timişoara.\",\n  \"text-8\": \"John Hunyadi was like a prince from Transylvania, and because he had this title, he was also the ruler of Timișoara. He ordered that the old palace in the fortress is also reinforced. He was concerned with the town's safety, so he brought canons and built defensive walls.\",\n  \"text-9\": \"The fortress of Timișoara became stronger and stronger.

He joined the army as a simple soldier, and because he was brave and good with strategy he quickly became captain general and then count (the ruler of the entire territory around Timișoara during the rein of Matthias Corvinus). He was a skilled military leader that managed to defeat the Ottomans (the Turks) a number of times.\",\n  \"text-12\": \"The legend says he could lift 2 Turks at once and carry then under his arms (that's like lifting weights at the gym today). As long as Pavel was leading the army, the dangerous Turks didn't invade the fortress of Timișoara.
